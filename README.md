<h3> ABOUT </h3>

<p> The goal is to design and implement a trend analysis engine. This engine should be able to take as input a table of raw data and present an interface for trend analysis.

<h2>QUICKSTART: </h2>

>Clone the respository and inside the root folder run
>
>python main.py ~/filepath/filename.csv
>
>
> The whitehouse.csv is the best testing file given. As airquality was not of the proper input. 
> Note: this is written in Python 3
